# Running tests

We do Test Driven Development here. If you don't know how to do that, ask Ben and he'll help you.

First, install QT (using Homebrew, MacPorts or your favorite package manager)

$ sudo port install qt4-mac

OR

$ brew install qt

Next, install the ruby version listed in .ruby-version. Install the gems listed in darkness.gems [You can use RVM for this](http://rvm.io/gemsets/importing).

You can have your browser automatically reload the page when it changes by installing the [Chrome LiveReload Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en)

Run guard using `guard`. It should hopefully run some tests.
