# Running tests

We do Test Driven Development here. If you don't know how to do that, ask Ben and he'll help you.

First, make sure you can install [jasmine-headless-webkit](http://johnbintz.github.io/jasmine-headless-webkit). If you have all the dependencies, installing the project gems should just work. If you are missing some dependencies, it probably won't work.

Next, install the ruby version listed in .ruby-version. Install the gems listed in darkness.gems [You can use RVM for this]().

You can have your browser automatically reload the page when it changes by installing the [Chrome LiveReload Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en)
