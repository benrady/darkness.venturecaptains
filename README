# Running tests

We do Test Driven Development here. If you don't know how to do that, ask Ben and he'll help you.

First, make sure you can install [jasmine-headless-webkit](http://johnbintz.github.io/jasmine-headless-webkit). If you have all the dependencies, installing the project gems should just work. If you are missing some dependencies, it probably won't work.

Next, install the ruby version and gems listed in .ruby-version and .ruby-gemset. [You can use RVM for this]().
